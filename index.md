# About SitePerf
SitePerf is an ultimate endpoint monitoring tool for DevOps and QA Engineers. 


## Configuration
Over last several years we have used multiple different tools. They usually had one thing in common - inconvenient configuration using clumsy and slow UI interface. 

As a modern engineers we all prefere to utilize the Infrastructure as Code principle - yet many of those tools do not provide proper public APIs to manage them. 

At SitePerf we took a different approach. We allow only programmatic configuration through API - to make it easy we provide a fully operational Terraform provider that can configure literally every aspect of your SitePerf account.
